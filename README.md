This template can be used to store various analysis. Different folders are used to store specific files. This section can be used to share information about the analysis such as source of data, pre processing methods and results. 

The data is download from ```PRJNA723064```.
# Instructions of data download
The data is downloaded with the help for [SRA toolkit] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/toolkitsoft/).
1. Download the meta data and fastq files in ```.sra``` format using following code:
```prefetch PRJNA723064```

2. Use the ```fastq-dump``` command to extract the FASTQ files from the downloaded data: 
```fastq-dump --split-files --gzip PRJNA723064```
Ensure the files are in correct paths. You will need about 4.5 GB disk space.


Hello Arjun, 

Hope you are having a great day. Thank you for reaching out to me with this opportunity. 

I read the job description you sent, and I may be a good fit for this position. I have worked on carrying out differential expression analyses on data from various experiments. With my experience at NextRNA Therapeutics, I have worked on supporting the team by analyzing transcriptomics data to help discover long non-coding RNA targets for small molecules to treat cancers. I am proficient with Python and R, and am capable of troubleshooting some issues in cluster and cloud computing. I am familiar with data resources such as TCGA, DepMap, ENCODE and NCBI. I am currently learning about building interactive user interface and have made an RShiny app, which I keep upgrading as I learn more. This app and samples of my code can be found on my github link

I don't have experience with functional genomics data and building machine learning models, yet; however, I am eager to learn. If given an opportunity, I can learn with some guidance. 

and I think I will be a perfect fit for it. I am attaching my CV here which has my contact information. I am available from Monday to Friday from 8 am to 6 pm EDT. Let me know what time works best for you. Looking forward to hearing back from you. 

Once again, thank you for your time and consideration. Have a fantastic week ahead. 
Regards, 
Pankti
